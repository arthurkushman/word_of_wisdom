The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall
Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful
The only way to do great work is to love what you do
Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life
In the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years
The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate
You must be the change you wish to see in the world
Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it
Happiness is not something ready-made. It comes from your own actions
